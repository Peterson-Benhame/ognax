Deploying a Lovable.dev Project to GitHub Pages
link to the blog to get free custom .me domain name Free custom domain for your projects üòâ

Here is the link to my portfolio, generated by lovable.dev and hosted on GitHub Pages
Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed on your system.
Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub.
Step 1: Connect lovable.dev with GitHub
connect github

Click View on GitHub.
Clone this private project locally on your machine.
Open a terminal in your cloned repository location. First, we are going to remove all Git files. For Windows, type:
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
# Check if Git files still exist
git status
This will remove all Git-related files from your project.
Now we can try running the project locally:
npm install       # Install all dependencies
npm run build
npm run dev
6.Make any changes to the code if needed.

Step 2: Create a New Repo for GitHub Pages and Update Config
Create a new repository, say coderatul-portfolio, on GitHub.
Clone this newly created repository to your machine.
Copy and paste all files from your original project (where Git was removed) to this new repo coderatul-portfolio.
You may now delete the initially cloned repository, as we have all source code where we need it.
Update vite.config.ts
The base property in the Vite configuration file (vite.config.ts) must be set to the repository name for GitHub Pages. This ensures that all asset paths are correctly resolved.

Example:

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import path from "path";
import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  server: {
    host: "::",
    port: 8080,
  },
  plugins: [
    react(),
    mode === 'development' &&
    componentTagger(),
  ].filter(Boolean),
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
  base: '/coderatul-portfolio/' // Replace with your GitHub repo name
}));
Step 3: Push Code to GitHub and Set Up Workflow via GitHub Actions
Push the changes to your repository say coderatul-portfolio here:
git status
git add .
git commit -m "adding project"
git push -u origin main
Grant access for workflow: Visit https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>/settings/actions, scroll down, make the necessary changes, and save.
permission

In your repository, go to Settings > Pages
t0

Select GitHub Actions
Then select GitHub Pages Jekyll and click Configure
t1

Edit the workflow
t2

Modify workflow.yaml as follows:
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  id-token: write 
  contents: write 
  pages: write    

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18 

      - name: Vite GitHub Pages Deployer
        uses: skywarth/vite-github-pages-deployer@v1.5.0
        with:
          public_base_path: /coderatul-portfolio/  # Replace with your repository name
          build_path: ./dist
          install_phase_node_env: dev
          build_phase_node_env: production
          package_manager: npm
          artifact_name: github-pages
          debug_mode: false
          working_path: ./
Step 4: Verify the Deployment
Make appropriate changes, paste the modified workflow.yaml, commit it, and the workflow will start under the Actions tab.
Under Settings > Pages, you‚Äôll see a live link to the deployed project.
What is a Workflow?
A workflow automates the process: any time you push code, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your project. This is part of CI/CD.

Common Issues and Fixes
1. Blank Page After Deployment
Make sure the base property in vite.config.ts is correctly set to /repository-name/.
Clear browser cache or use incognito mode.
2. 403 Permission Errors
Ensure the GITHUB_TOKEN in your workflow has the correct permissions:
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: write
  pages: write
3. Asset Paths Not Resolving
Double-check the base property in vite.config.ts and ensure it matches your repo name.
Conclusion
Deploying a lovable.dev project to GitHub Pages is simple with the right setup. By setting the base path in vite.config.ts and automating deployment using GitHub Actions, you can publish your project effortlessly.

A quick update. I have no clue if Github changed the default pages route now but according to their docs you must name your repo <username>.github.io. This will automatically be your base route (so https://.github.io). Therefore, in the vite.config.ts, the base path must be

import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";
import path from "path";
import { componentTagger } from "lovable-tagger";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  server: {
    host: "::",
    port: 8080,
  },
  plugins: [
    react(),
    mode === 'development' &&
    componentTagger(),
  ].filter(Boolean),
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
    },
  },
  base: '/' // Since this will be the base directory
}));
Additionally, you need to change the base path destination in the workflow.yaml file accordingly


on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

permissions:
  id-token: write 
  contents: write 
  pages: write    

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18 

      - name: Vite GitHub Pages Deployer
        uses: skywarth/vite-github-pages-deployer@v1.5.0
        with:
          public_base_path: /  # This is the base
          build_path: ./dist
          install_phase_node_env: dev
          build_phase_node_env: production
          package_manager: npm
          artifact_name: github-pages
          debug_mode: false
          working_path: ./

my repo name is coderatul.github.io and i set base path to this only

in workflow : public_base_path: /coderatul.github.io/
and in vite config file: base: '/coderatul.github.io/'

and it works maybe you forgot : /repo name/ (the slashesh)

anyway i went through your github and yours seems working with base as / so thanks for commenting this people facing issue might get it right with base as /

@girish_singh_2000 i think you didn't followed the steps correctly, the repo you have shared is the same repo generated by lovable and not according to the steps mentioned above

I cloned the lovable repo as it is in my pc and then followed all the steps (The files were copy pasted from the lovable repo) is there anything prior steps that I missed? The repo linked with lovable is different ("de-portfolio" in my Github. let me know the reasons you think it is same then maybe I could try again resolving those.

I had issues with it not working, with page not found, blank page etc. so i deleted it all and gave up lol, but now i realised it might be because my repo was privet and githubpages requires a public repo to display it for free, so if your repo is private set it to public lol
